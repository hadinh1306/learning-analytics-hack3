## **Ideas:**
--whether students with higher depreviation score have different success rate than those with lower score?--

- **Withdrawn rate: compare students who withdraw specific courses and those who don't to see if we can do sth about it.**

## **Idea building:**
- aggregate data to withdraw or pass level: total students in these 2 categories are comparable, fail is controversial, distinction is around 10%
- weight & grade: Exam (100%) -- can be more than 2 exams, Others (summed to 100%)
  - grade*(weight/sum of weights)

## **Hypothesis:**
- Those who withdraw might register very close to the course. (look at mean/median of date registration)
- Date unregistration (for withdraw): what the mean/median so we can help marketing effort.
- Compare activity_type (engagement) between Stay and Withdraw (look at clicks). If Stay clicks more in any activity, it might be a very engaging point to decide whether to stay or not.

## **Data to filter:**
- StudentInfo:
  - student_credits
  - code_presentation: 2013

## **Things to check:**
- check if late submission is allowed
- see if courses have any exam(s) or assessments

## **Visualization ideas:**
- time series of click changes through time
- draw it out
